# How my week has been so far
## The Environment 
My week has been a very fantastic set of days and within me enjoying my week comes with the perks of loving 
the environment that I find myself within. The most part that I like about my environment is that it has a Free Wifi connection and I also
have my own working station.

## The people
The most fun way to have a very fantastic week is to have friends that will enlighten your mood. The people who have been
around me the whole week are loving, caring and considerate. Every morning we are welcomed with warm hands and have a morning
session where we discuss how our days have been and what have we learned.

## Food 
We as people can never deny the fact that we love free food. The food I have been having is delicious but when my mood 
depreciated from happy to sad was when I found bread which had **passed** the best before date.

## My Challanges
Learning new things comes with challanges and I have been going through some myself. The challanges that I have been having is 
knowing the Html codes because there are many of them and I have challanges going through CSS but whenever I have challanges
assistances is always close by
