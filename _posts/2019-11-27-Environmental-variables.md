# What are Environmental Variables?

Two fundamental components of any computer programming language are variables and constants. Like independent variables in a mathematical equation, these take on values that change the results of the program. Variables and constants both represent unique memory locations containing data the program uses in its calculations. The difference between the two is that variables values may change during execution, while constant values cannot be reassigned.

An *environment variable* is a variable whose value is set outside the program, typically through functionality built into the operating system or microservice. An environment variable is made up of a name/value pair, and any number may be created and available for reference at a point in time.
