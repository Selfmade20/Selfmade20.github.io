#What is Splice?

The splice function is a **javascript** that can add,remove and replace values within an array and 
it is mostly commonly used in arrays.

##Splice's parameter values

1. **Index** - An integer that specifies at what position to add or remove items.
2. **How many** - The number of items you want to be removed.
3. **Item1,...ItemX** - This adds a new item

#What is Slice?

The Slice is also a **javascript** method that returns the selected elements in an array, as a new 
array object. The slice method selects the elements starting at the given start argument, and ends 
at the given end argument.


##Slice's parameter values 

1. **Start** - An integer that specifies where to start the selection 
2. **End** - An integer that specifies where to end the selection.


###My basic understanding 

In my own understanding splice and slice are almost the same but they don't perform the same tasks,
the splice is majorly used to add and remove values but the slice is a method to return elements 
selected in an array as a new array object.
