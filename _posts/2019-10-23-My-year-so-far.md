# 2019 for "ME"
This year is full of wonders and challenges, never thought my life would turn out for the better this way because at 
first I was sceptical about what I wanted to do but I always knew that I would love to do something which involves Software Programming or anything that involves the curiosity around computers. I would like to take this moment to thank **The Coding Ground** for the opportunity given to me to craft myself into a better me, to me coding is something new as I've never interacted with it during the previous years of my life and it's quite thrilling that I got the hook of it because I've done html before at school so when I came to The Coding Ground the first thing in the curriculum was html.

## The environment 
The environment at **The Coding Ground** is quite actually the best you could find in a learning environment because you learn at your own pace, other institutions are different whereby you feel like you are pressured into doing the learning. The leaders at TCG are the most lenient and wonderful you could meet. The biggest thing I know and I respect about them is the efforts, the time and the dedication they put towards making us better people of the future.

## Where do you see yourself in 2020?
Just a few **months** left for me to go into 2020 and I don't think I've done as much as I should, but then I should see myself somewhere in 2020. My goal for 2020 is to work harder than before and acknowledge the privilege that has been given to me and make use of it in the best way possible. By Next year I wish to see myself being good at *React* and *Redux* and I see myself working on client projects with my group.
