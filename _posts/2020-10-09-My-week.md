# How my week was?

This past weeks have been really exciting and challanging as I've been working on a project with my team on SQL and I've never been as deep as I am into Sql, unffortunelty I cannot disclose the information as the project is still under developement. But It is mainly the sql stuff which is being done all around with sql which is managing the data in your database.

# Challenges 

The challanges I initially face were actually connecting to a sql database which is something which I have never done before, so I had to use an sql client software application and database administator tool which is DBeaver. Like I said I would not be able to disclose the information about the project as of yet but you can read of what I have learned below.

# What have I learned?

This past week have been a really steep learning curve as I've been exposed to a workplace envoronment whereby you work in teams to complete a certain client's needs. And this helps in doing self-introspections of what do I need to do to complete the work. I've learned a lot about how sql works, database management tools, deploying and also managing an app in production.
