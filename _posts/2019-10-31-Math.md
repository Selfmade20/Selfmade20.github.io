# Math

Math is a built-in object that has properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. Not a function object.Math works with the Number type.

## Description

Unlike the other global objects, Math is not a constructor. All properties and methods of Math are static. You refer to the constant pi as Math.PI and you call the sine function as Math.sin(x), where x is the method's argument. Constants are defined with the full precision of real numbers in JavaScript.
