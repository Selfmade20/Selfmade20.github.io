#Life-cycle methods

#What are React lifecycle methods?
React lifecycle methods are the series of events that happen from the birth of a React component to its death.

Every component in React goes through a lifecycle of events. I like to think of them as going through a cycle of birth, growth, and death.

1.Mounting – Birth of your component
2.Update – Growth of your component
3.Unmount – Death of your component

##Common React Lifecycle Methods Are:

1.render()
2.componentDidMount()
3.componentDidUpdate()
4.componentWillUnmount()

##Uncommon React Lifecycle Methods Are:

1.shouldComponentUpdate()
2.static getDerivedStateFromProps()
3.getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
