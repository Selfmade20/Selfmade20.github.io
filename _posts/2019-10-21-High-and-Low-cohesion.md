# High Cohesion

Cohesion is the extent to which two or more parts of a system are related and how they work together to create something more valuable than the individual parts. Think of the old adage, “The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.”

People seek high cohesion in sports teams, for example. They want to have a team of basketball players that know how and when to pass the ball, and how and when to score. Everyone expects the individual players to play together as a team to increase the chances of the team winning the game. Companies also seek cohesion in their project teams at work. They put developers and user interface designers together with business analysts and database administrators, along with other roles and responsibilities. The intent of creating teams of cross-functional skill sets is to use the strengths of each team member to counter the weaknesses of others. You likely also look for cohesion in the technology you are using and the software that you are writing. You probably want a database system that connects easily to your programming language of choice. You also want a user interface technology that makes it easy to wire up the business logic and data access. Cohesion is all around. You only need to recognize it for what it is.
