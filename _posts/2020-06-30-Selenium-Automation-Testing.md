# What is Selenium?

**Selenium** is a open source automated testing framework used to validate web application across different browsers and platforms.
Selenium can be used in different kinds of programming lanugages like Java, C#, Python etc to create Selenium Test Scripts.

Selenium Software is not a single handed tool but a suite of software.

# Who developed Selenium?

Selenium is a collection of different tools, it had different developers as well. Below are the key persons who made notable contributions to the Selenium Project.Primarily, Selenium was created by Jason Huggins in 2004. An engineer at ThoughtWorks, he was working on a web application that required frequent testing. Having realized that the repetitious Manual Testing of their application was becoming more and more inefficient, he created a JavaScript program that would automatically control the browser's actions. He named this program as the "JavaScriptTestRunner."

Seeing potential in this idea to help automate other web applications, he made JavaScriptRunner open-source which was later re-named as Selenium Core.
