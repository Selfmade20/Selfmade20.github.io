# Working on Quality Assurance projects

Working on quality assurance on freecodecamp was a very fun experience as we had assignments the previous and current month which involved working on the things I was currently doing on freecodecamp. The first project I had was "The Metric Imperial Converter" which was a bit tricky but I managed to complete, so on first project, I struggled because there were some tests which I researched and they were still throwing errors, and I noticed that glitch has some glitches.

The second project was "The Issue Tracker" and on the project, I had problems with my *PUT* and *DELETE* routes which required me to update and delete, on the delete method you were supposed to delete an issue on my rest API targeting it by the id and hopefully I've worked on a similar project which allowed me to add, edit, search and delete items, so I went back to my Github repo and went through the process and I managed to complete the project. When I faced such challenges I didn't think about blogging which was my stupid mistake, but then when I faced challenges on the second project I no longer considered hours given to complete the project, I just changed my computer window and worked on the other stuff which I had eg. **Codewars**"* It's challenging*"ðŸ˜„ and practicing react hooks by creating side projects to practice on react. 

I completed the Issue tracker and the next project was the Personal Library which is also similar to a project I had done, my emotions got the better of me when I discovered that I had failed my assignments because I had dedicated too much time to them and I had a call from Mr. Jason who then asked me about my progress on freecodecamp and I explained to him that I'm working on Quality assurance projects and he asked me how much time do I need before I can complete the projects and I asked for a time window of 2 weeks to complete the 3 remaining and from those 2 weeks I managed to complete the projects.

On the "Sodoku Solver" I was very confused even when reading the user stories because I have never been a fan of sodoku so I was a bit confused and I referred to Github which helped a lot because I could see what other programmers did on the project and I could try and implement the method on my own. I also went the same way when trying to complete the "American British Translator" as I was also under pressure to complete the projects. I couldn't complete the projects in 5 hours as I was around the learning curve some of the stuff you just type on the internet and get the solutions but somethings need you to understand them, like the last projects I had because when I referred to sites I know could help me some of the projects weren't done there, so I had to be on my own.

# How was working on Quality Assurance projects

Working on the projects was fun because they were all almost the same. After all, as a learning programmer, I got a chance to work on the server-side and learn how to create rest API's and handling all the data on the API and it was challenging but the way to learn is through practice and that's why I now 101% dedicated to learning everything every day. This involves watching tutorials and interview questions of the world's most influential companies which have software engineers and I believe that in the 1 year 6 months that I have been here I've learned a lot.
