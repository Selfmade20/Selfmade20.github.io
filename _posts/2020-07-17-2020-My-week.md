# My week and challanges I faced

The week has been wonderful and filled with new stuff, so this week I had an assginement where I had to Create a basic authentication system that you can reuse for all your future apps that require authentication. It has been a wonderful experience as It is the first working on Authentication below is a description of what I managed to solve and what I'm still working on.


# What I have accomplished so far

For the Authentification assignment I managed to create a the landing page which is the homepage route which any user who accesses the web app will be redirected to, then I created a signup route for users who do not have the access to access private routes which are designed for users whic are already registerd but the signup component has not yet been set up as it's not top priority on the assignments to do list. I then created a login form for user's which have registerd to be able to log in and it's the part which I have beeen struggling with, I watched some videos which may come in a as help and I'm looking forward to cracking the part where users who have logged in are automatically generated tokens so that security should be good to clients.
