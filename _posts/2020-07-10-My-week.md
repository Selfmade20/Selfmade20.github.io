# My week

My week has been fantastic because of the assignments we received at TCG but I never thought I can get them done due to the time frame but gracefully I managed to do what was required on the assignment.

# What have I learned?
I've been working on creating an app using React which is a javascript framework for building user interfaces for web apps. The app was supposed to have a list of events and the user was supposed to have the ability to book a specific event and then fill in a form in which the form data would be persisted to the MongoDB database.

On the first days, everything was running smoothly and I didn't have any problems, but when it came to connecting my application to the database it was a little hard but I remembered that I've once worked on the databases before and I've managed to put little extra hours and a little effort to get the tasks done.
