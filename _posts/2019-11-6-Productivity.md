# 🌟 Clarify Your Purpose for Waking Up Early
Waking up before everyone else is tough. If you don’t have a reason to do it, you won’t do it.
I don’t just mean purpose in the sense that you want to wake up to do something. Of course, you’re going to wake up early to do something (probably productive). But you need a purpose that extends past a basic task.
I’m about to graduate from university and I’m about to enter arguably the most important years of my life — years where I’ll have both money and freedom. If I ever want a chance at escaping at the 9–5, I have to do something now. Working in the morning is easier than working at night, so I need to set up my habits now so I can be living that life later.
You might already have a purpose, but if you don’t, try running a 5 Whys analysis (otherwise known as root cause analysis).
To do the 5 Whys:
Form a problem statement.
Ask the question: “Why is/are/does [your problem statement]?”. Use your answer as the next problem statement.
Keep asking “why” until you’ve asked it five or more times.
Example:
1. I want to wake up at 5 a.m. every day.
2. Why do you want to wake up at 5 a.m. every day?
3. I want more time to be productive.
4. Why do you want to be more productive?
5. I want to practice writing.
6. Why do you want to practice writing?
7. I want to write books.
8. Why do you want to write books?
9. I want to have a career doing something creative.
10. Why do you want to have a career doing something creative?

I imagine it to be the most fulfilling thing someone can do in their career.
Starting with a smaller problem and going deep to find the root cause helps you gain a better understanding of what you really want. It’ll help you understand if waking up is part of the solution to your problem.
Waking up early gives you a few hours every day in the morning where nobody else is going to disturb you. That’s all it is for most of us. For me, though, that’s an important part of my solution to escaping a 9–5 rut and doing work I love.
## 💪 Understand What You Gain and Lose

If you accept what you lose upfront, you won’t keep trying to hold onto it when it’s gone.
But let’s be optimistic and start with what you’ll gain.
What you gain
Being an early bird means you get a few hours every day to do whatever you want. It’s likely nobody else will be awake to disturb you. You can paint, start a business, write — anything you want.
Your prefrontal cortex is most active right after waking up, making it optimal for creativity. I’ve noticed I write much faster in the morning than at any other time in the day. Looking at the habits of famous writers, a lot of them have figured it out too (most authors write in the morning).
It’s a big win: a few hours of solitude with your most creative self.
What you lose
There’s no free lunch. Waking up early doesn’t give you extra time. It takes off time you would otherwise have at night — unless you sleep less, which is a bad idea. If you sleep less, you either won’t be able to wake up early and become a night owl again, or you’ll be sleep-deprived and unproductive throughout the day.

## Give yourself one day off per week
I’ve found that if I mess up my sleep schedule one day a week, I can still maintain it throughout the week. I tried sleeping late two or three days a week — it didn’t work. But one seems to be okay.
I love going out at night, so I’ve given myself one day a week (usually Friday) to hang out with friends for longer.
If this is something you need to do to wake up early, I suggest you set rules for it, too. You’re less likely to fail with disciplined chaos than pure chaos. Give yourself one day a week where you’re allowed to break the rules to mitigate what you feel you are losing.

## Compare the benefits with the cost

### Ask yourself these two questions:
**What will I gain with the extra time in the morning?**
**What will I lose with the lost time at night?**
Then ask yourself: “Do the benefits outweigh the costs?”
If they don’t, then there’s probably no point in waking up early. If they do, there are a few things that helped me that’ll probably help you.

## 😴 Focus on Sleeping Time
## Get enough sleep

A common mistake people make is thinking they can sleep the same amount as they usually do. For example, I only slept for 6 hours before, so I thought I could sleep for 6 hours and still wake up early. This doesn’t work because you end up sleeping in; it’s unlikely you have any willpower when it’s pitch black outside.
For the best chances at waking up early, set a goal for 8 hours of sleep. I want to wake up at 5 a.m., so my sleeping time is 9 p.m. (8 hours before).
Sleep more than needed (when you start)
When I started, I didn’t set my alarm at 5 a.m. I set no alarm at all. With drastic changes to your sleeping schedule, you’re going to need some time to adjust. You initially need more sleep.
You have the rest of your life to wake up early. Spend some time now getting the habit into your routine. This is a marathon, not a sprint.
Waking up early means waking up when it’s still dark. Give your body some time to adjust to the darkness. It took me about a week; it might be longer or shorter for you.
I naturally woke up earlier and earlier every day. Now I can successfully wake up at 5 a.m. every day.
