# What is Vue JS ?

- So according to my understanding and what I've learned Vue js is a framework used for building single paged web applications and is much more easier to use compared to other applications creation frameworks.

**Vue JS** was originally realeased by Evan You as his own framework and gradually gained momentum because people thought it was easier to use Vue compared to other framework.
