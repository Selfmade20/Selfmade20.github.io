#Higher Order Components

Higher order components, in general, are a functional programmming methodology. However, 
this blog does not require any functional programming knowledge but requires some basic 
knowledge in React. In order to have more understanding you should know, React components,
props, Lifecycle methods and how to build a basic app using React.


## What is HOC's?

A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.
A higher order function is a function that accepts another function as an arguments. You would
have already used the map function which falls under this category.


#Higher order component in React example

const reverse = (PassedComponent) =>
  ({ children, ...props }) =>
    <PassedComponent {...props}>
      {children.split("").reverse().join("")}
    </PassedComponent>

const name = (props) => <span>{props.children}</span>
const reversedName = reverse(name)
<reversedName>Hello</reversedName>
//=> <span>olleH</span>
