# Patternfly

- There are two parts that Patternfly will help you efficiently design and develop enterprise web applications.
- It has the widget library which implements enterprise-optimized visual styling for common web UI widgets and a pattern library which includes a set of interaction patterns that offer consistent solutions to common user interaction problems.

## Accessibility

- Their color palletes meet AAA standards, which means that their color pallets are up to standard.
- It previously had no standard for accessibility beyond best efforts. which means that the current Patternfly will improve, however, it's still a mixed bag.

## Moving away from Bootstrap

- Trying Patternfly to Bootstrap was great because you could easily theme bootstrap and build on top of a solid system.
- But one of the disadvantages is that they were tied to their release cycle and any long-term decisions they would make.

## Consistency?

- Consistency leads to better usability. Applications become intuitive when common mental models are leveraged and users are not required to relearn interactions when moving between applications. When users look at your application, you want them to think, ‚ÄúI know how this works because it‚Äôs similar to things I‚Äôve used before.‚Äù Patterns do allow for innovation on top of a common baseline that will enable your application to stand out from the crowd.

## What makes Patternfly different from other libraries?

- There are other good general web UI pattern libraries out there, but Patternfly felt like nono of them were optimized for the enterprise IT space

# RED HATüß¢

- Red Hat, Inc. is an American multinational software company that provides open-source software products to enterprises and the developer of Patternfly.

# REACTJS

## Pros of React

- **Virtual DOM** - The Document Object Model (DOM) defines the tree-like structure of an HTML document. There are regular browser checks for changes to the DOM and updates it accordingly when using Reactjs the browser updates the DOM each time a change appears. reducing the time updates may take when running a real _Web Page_ against a _Real DOM_ and it offers high performance and efficiency.

- **Reusable components** - ReactJS supports creating reusable components. Once a UI component is created, it can be used in other parts of code or even in different projects with little or no changes. When using Reactjs you can use _open-source_ libraries of prebuilt components, this helps to cut down the time required for UI development, which is crucial for startups that need to save money and time.

- **Downward data flow** - Reactjs has one of the features developers consider beneficial, which is data flow also called top to bottom or parent to child. It means there's only one-way data is transmitted between the elements in a Reacjs application. A downward data flow prevents errors and facilitates debugging.

_There are still more Pros for Reactjs but I've chosen to mention the few above as they are the major recognized ones._

## Cons of React

- **Poor documentation** - Reactjs is a relatively new technology, and it keeps growing but documentation for Reactjs and its related libraries is often lacking. Developers usually release updates to libraries without updating the documentation.

- **Confusing JSX** - Reactjs uses the JSX syntax extension for creating javascript objects with HTML syntax. This simplifies the process of DOM modifications and makes code more readable and having HTML syntax in Javascript code can seem confusing for young developers, so they'll need time to get used to it.

- **Narrow focus on UI** - Reactjs is a JavaScript library that contains a collection of tools for creating web application UIs. But in contrast to frameworks, ReactJS is not an all-in-one tool for creating a whole application.

## Summing up

ReactJS has proven efficient in creating interactive UIs. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs used extensively by a wide range of renowned websites.üëç
