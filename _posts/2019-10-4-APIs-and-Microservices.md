# What Is a Microservice?

Microservice refers to the individual service in a microservice architecture. A microservice architecture is an
architectural style for modern web apps where the functionality is broken up into smaller fragments, and this 
is normally the idea people are trying to convey when they talk about microservices.

# What is an API?

API stands for Application Programming Interface, where the keyword is interface. APIs are the doorways, so to speak,
that allow developers to interact with an application.APIs have been around since the dawn of computing, enabling computers to call repeat functions to decrease application bloat.

# The Difference Between APIs and Microservices?

**Microservices** - are an architectural style for web applications, where the functionality is divided up across small web services.

whereas

**APIs** - are the frameworks through which developers can interact with a web application.
