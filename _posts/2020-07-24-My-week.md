# My week and challenges I faced

This week I was still working on the authentication and managed to learn a few stuff but still didn't manage to give the expected result as I feel so. I had problems when it came to accessing protected routes for authenticated users in my front-end.

# What I have accomplished so far

So far I've managed to add different routes for the users and protected some of the routes but still didn't finish one on the requirements which were required. I managed to do some research and look at authentification tutorials but most of the tutorials the developer's user view engines e.g (pug, ejs). So there is no part where they use react front-end and my challenge was that I'm using react to render my front-end. I'm still trying to figure the solution out but hopefully, I'm going to reach the expected outcome.
