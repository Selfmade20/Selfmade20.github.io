# My week and what have I been busy with?

So this week I didn't have much work rather than learning the usual which is working on Freecodecamp and practicing my programming skills. I do not feel well as I have written tests this month and I don't think I passed those tests even thought I tried my best, the one which I feel like I didn't even do the least is the test we wrote on react because I didn't understand what was needed especially on the second question as I didn't do the second question.

# What can I do to make sure I pass my tests next time?
The only way to make sure that I pass my tests next time is by challanging myself by wathing crash course videos and then put myself up to the challange of creating my own practice tests and see how my learning progress is going.I will surely give and update about how that goes on the next blog.
