# What is an Event Listener?

An event listener is a procedure or function in a computer program that waits for an event to occur; that event may be a user clicking or moving the mouse, pressing a key on the keyboard, or an internal timer or interrupt. The listener is in effect a loop that is programmed to react to an input or signal.

# Different methods that can be used in Event Listening

## Event Delegation
Event delegation promotes binding as few DOM event handlers as possible, since each event handler requires memory. For example, letâ€™s say that we have an HTML unordered list we want to bind event handlers to. Instead of binding a click event handler for each list item (which may be hundreds for all we know), we bind one click handler to the parent unordered list itself.

## Debounce
There are several situations in JavaScript where you want a function that is bound to an event to fire only once after a specific amount of time has passed. Functions bound to the resize and scroll events are the typical candidates. Invoking a function every time one of these events fires will significantly impact performance. Enter the JavaScript debounce function.

## RequestAnimationFrame
If you have the urge to perform animations in Javascript, then you have probably used a setTimeout or setInterval to achieve this. This is bad for a whole number of reasons, the biggest one being they will suck performance from your visitors browser and flatten their little phone batteries.

## Throttling
Throttling is a straightforward reduction of the trigger rate. It will cause the event listener to ignore some portion of the events while still firing the listeners at a constant (but reduced) rate.
