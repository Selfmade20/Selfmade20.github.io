# My week and what have I been busy with?

So this week I didn't have much work rather than learning the usual which is working on Freecodecamp and practicing my programming skills. I've also been working on practicing react hooks as I am more familiar with react class based components but functional components are more of the latest and short way to solve everything. I really enjoy react hooks and I'm really looking forward to learning the more indepth of react hooks

# What is learning look like in coming time ?

I'm very confident that I'm a fast learner, I just need to put in more time and by next year I'm hopeful that I'll be part of a big programming company working as a developer because I enjoy what I am doing.
