# How my week was?

This week has been pretty good as I was working on the usual stuff of the week which is Code wars and practicing my react skills. This week we had a test which was a closed book test and for me, I found it pretty hard to complete all the requirements. On the test we were required to create a registration app that was supposed to allow users to register and login, also be able to view their registration info and be able to update the info and all the user information was supposed to be saved into the MongoDB database.

# Challenges 

The challenges that I faced on the task was actually connecting my backend to the frontend without even using google and doing post request from the frontend to the database was actually tricky without looking it up on google. I feel like I didn't complete most of the requirements on the app but it proves that I still need to learn a lot and I tried.

# What have I learned?

I've learned that every single app you will build will have some mechanism of handling users (registration, login, session management).
