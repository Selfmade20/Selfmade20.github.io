#Pomodoro Timer

##What is a pomodoro timer technique?
The pomodoro timer technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the
late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes
in length, separated by a short brakes. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word
for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

The technique has been widerly popularized by dozens of apps and websites providing timers and instructions.Pomodoro is closely related to consepts such as timeboxing and iterative and incremental development used in software design, the method has been adopted in pair programming contexts.
