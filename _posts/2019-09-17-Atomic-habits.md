# Atomic Habits

The premise of Atomic Habits by James Clear is that it’s very easy to underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too often we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action.
Why should we try to get a little better each day? Well, take a look at the following amazing maths.

If you can get 1% better each day over the next year, you’ll be 37 times better by the time you’re done. This applies to all goals, whether it is losing weight, winning a race, or starting a business.
Small habits can compound over time. In fact, according to Atomic Habits, habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effect of your habits multiplies as you repeat them. They seem to make little or even no difference on any given day but the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous.

# What are Atomic Habits?
You’ve probably already worked it out, but Atomic Habits are small tiny habits. Just like atoms, they are small but they have the ability to be mighty. Atomic habits become mighty when they are repeated hundreds or even thousands of times.
Bad habits compound too. Putting off a project to tomorrow seems to make no difference. But when you repeat this type of 1% error day after day, these tiny errors can compound into toxic results.
