# What have I learned from working on SQL 

I recently got a project on SQL and what I understood about it is that I was going to be communitcating with a database somehow but I've never used Sql databases so this past day was about learning new things. I faced challanged of understanding how to connect to the database from my react app since I'm used to working on MongoDB and I learned the key difference between Mongodb and SQL Servers.

## Key differences between MongoDB and SQL Server

- MongoDB is more fast and scalable in comparison to the SQL server.
- MongoDB doesn’t support JOIN and Global transactions but the SQL server supports it.
- MongoDB supports a big amount of data but the MS SQL server doesn’t.
- MongoDB support Agile practices but MS SQL server doesn’t support it.
- MongoDB schema is dynamic but MS SQL server schema is fixed.
- Ms. SQL server provides XML support but MongoDB doesn’t.
