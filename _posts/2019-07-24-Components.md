# Components

# What are components?

Components are the building blocks of any React app and a typical React app will have many of these.Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

# Parent Component

A parent component is a component that has a wider scope and a child component is a component that is apart of that scope but not all of it.

# The history of Components

Componenents are part of React and React was introduced to improve front developer's work
because of the need for a better code. Back in 2011 the developers at Facebook started to face some issued with code maintenance. As the Facebook ads got an increasing number of features, the team needed more people to keep it running flawlessly. The growing number of team-members and app-features slowed them down as a company. Over time, their app became difficult to handle, as they faced a lot of cascading updates.
