# How was quarantine?

The pandemic has been affecting people from all corners of the world and it's been tough, the saddest moment was when we had to close schools because the virus was just only beginning and I can say staying at home has been some very lonely and boring time.
During the lockdown, I was not able to do much work as I didn't have a laptop to work but then weeks later Mr. Jason approached Collen and me to work on a project which involved PHP and Databases. I enjoyed working on the project because Collen came to my place every day so that we can work on the project but the problem was that the project was really difficult and eye-opening, we searched for solutions on Google but solutions were few because most people had worked on the same issued 6 years ago and just I was asking myself when will TCG reopen the time came for us to reopen.

# How was the first week at TCG?

Going back to TCG was fun because you constantly remind yourself of what you want to achieve in life and that pushes you to work hard. I was very happy when Mr. Jason got us another project to work on which is from the USA and Collen and I are currently working on it, It's based on Selenium Automation Testing and I'm glad to be working on such a project because it's based on the programming language C# and I've never done C# before but then I take it as a learning curve. I've never had this much drive workingðŸ˜‚ I think it's because this is an interview project and it's from the USA. I'm looking forward to doing much bigger things and I've been carrying on with the same previous routine which is to work on FreeCode Camp, Type Racer, Codewars, and Other side projects.
