# What is Self-Confidence?

Self-Confidence is a way of being in the world that allows you to know yourself and to take care of 
yourself according to the book *The Portable Therapist*(1992) by Susanna McMahon. Mary Welford (2013)
describes self-confidence as being aware of when we're struggling and having the strength to commit to
doing something about it. Anneli Rufus(2014) asserts that self-confidence involves self-respect and 
having courage to tell the truth about who you are, what you like, and what you believe.

## Why is it important to be Self-Confident?

Having self-confidence is very important because it can push you towards success and lack of self-confidence
does not lead to success to the contrary it leads to holding back. Self-Confidence is needed to believe in 
one's own skills, goals, and ability to succeed.

## Here are 10 Reasons That Self-Confidence Leads to Success:

1.**The Drive to Start Things** – Confident people start things. They are not shy about striking out on a new idea even when those around them are still pondering it.
2.**The Ability to Stand Up for Oneself** – Confidence allows you to stand up for yourself in a fair and consistent manner. Otherwise, you may find yourself unheard or unfairly treated.
3.**The Ability to Say No** – Confident people have the ability to say “No” where appropriate. They do not take on unnecessary or inappropriate work or obligations.
4.**The Ability to Say Yes** – And at the same time, confident individuals say “Yes” to opportunity. They do not miss new options because they are shy. I have seen individuals’ pass up opportunities (even promotions) because they didn’t think they were “worthy.”
5.**Confidence Overcomes Fear** – Lack of confidence can lead to paralysis from fear. Fear of failure. Fear of what others think. Fear of the unknown. To succeed, you need the confidence to face and overcome your fears.
6.**Believe In Themselves** – Self-confidence means believing in yourself. Henry Ford said, “Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t — you’re right.” He was right.
7.**Set the Bar High Enough** – Confident individuals set the bar high and aim high. Lack of confidence leads to weak goals, setting the bar too low, and mediocre results.
8.**Stretch Your Limits** – Confidence lets you know your limits and test them. By stretching your limits you increase them. You are stronger than you think.
9.**Confidence Asks Questions** – Confidence allows you to ask questions, even when others are silent. Confidence even lets you “ask for the job.”
10.**Believe In Winning** – Confident people believe in success. And more importantly, they believe in their ability to succeed.
