# What is Cross Site Scripting?

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is a computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications. It enables attackers to bypass client-side security mechanisms normally imposed on web content by modern web browsers by injecting malicious script into web pages viewed by other users.

XSS can be a significant security risk depending on the sensitivity of your data. In versions of IBM® SPSS® Collaboration and Deployment Services previous to 5.0.0.0, a web security filter was available to help prevent XSS attacks by validating user-entered parameters. But all the filter criteria were embedded in the product and not available for editing or customization by users. With IBM SPSS Deployment Manager, users can now add, modify, and delete XSS filter rules based on their company's enterprise security policy.
