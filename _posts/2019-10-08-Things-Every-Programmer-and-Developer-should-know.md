# Things Every Programmers and Developer Should Know

1. Data Structures and Algorithms
If you want to become a programmer then you ought to know data structure and algorithms well; there’s no way around it.
This is one of the important topics of any programming job interview and without you knowing basic data structures (e.g. array, linked list, map, set) it’s not possible to write a real-world application.
That’s why every programmer should put serious effort to learn data structures and algorithms during their computer science course.
Even If you are a self-taught programmer, then also you must know data structures and algorithms; in fact, many programming bootcamp will teach you data structures and algorithms as the first thing.

2. Source Control
Source control is used to store code and if you want to become a coder or software developer, you must know version control tools like Git and SVN.
Thankfully Git and Github have streamlined the market and now more than 70% of organizations use Git, so you can probably get away by just learning Git.
By the way, you should put some effort into learning Git well, and you should be comfortable with advanced version control concepts like branching and merging as well as the tool itself using both the command line and GUI.

3.  Text Editors
There is not a single day when I have not used a text editor while working as programmers. It’s one of the essential tools even for non-programmers and anyone who works with computers.
I have mostly used NotePad on Windows and VI in Linux, but you have a lot of choices available in terms of advanced editors like Sublime and NotePad++, which provides IDE-like functionalities.
I suggest you spend some time learning your favorite editor and keyboard shortcuts, productivity tips are something you can learn. If you like Sublime then Sublime Text for Rapid Web Development is a good course to learn such things.

4.  Programming Languages
As a programmer, you must know a programming language: C++ or Java, or maybe Python or JavaScript. You can choose whatever you want to but my personal suggestion is that you should at least know Java.
It’s very easy to start with and that’s why a good choice for beginners. It’s also immensely powerful and allows you to virtually anything.
It has got libraries from doing basic stuff like web development to more complex tasks with Big Data and so on. If you decide to learn Java then The Complete Java MasterClass is probably the best place to start with
