# My week and what have I been busy with?

This week I've been busy with the normal programming stuff which is Freecodecamp and codewars and I couldn't help but watch some react hooks tutorials. Today we were given a suprise test which was pretty doable but required more time than the time we were given. I feel like I would have reached the required objective if there was extra time. So were were supposed to create a todo-list which was supposed to register the email and password and then add a todo with a countdown timer.

# What were you able to completer?

I was able to complete the connection to the database, and create some routes for the backend and I created the register form and the todo list but I wasn't able to connect the backend with my front-end. And I believe that I is due to time and still learning some stuff.
