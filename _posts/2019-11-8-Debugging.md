# What is Debugging?

Unlike Testing, Debugging is the activity carried out by the development team or a developer after getting the test report about the defects in the software from the testing team. The work of the developer is to find the cause of this defect or error, which is accomplished by checking the coding thoroughly. Once the bug or error is detected, developer modifies the portion of code and then rechecks whether the defect has been finally removed. Once the debugging is successfully culminated, the software is again sent to the tester who then continues the process of testing. Therefore, debugging is the process:

- Executed in the development phase by the developers.
- The developer aims at fixing the bug.
- Fixes bugs reported/identified by the testers or end user.
- Performed under tremendous amount of pressure to get correct results in a limited period of time.

# Benefits of Debugging:

In software development, debugging involves locating and correcting code errors in a computer program. Majorly performed while the software testing process, debugging is an integral part of the entire software development cycle. The process of debugging starts as soon as the code of the software is written and continues in successive stages as code is combined with other units of programming to form a software product. Some of the other benefits of debugging are mentioned below:

- **Reports error condition immediately**, which allows earlier detection of an error and makes the process of software development stress-free and unproblematic.
- It provides **maximum useful information** of data structures and allows its **easy interpretation**.
- Assists the developer in minimizing useless and distracting information.
- Through debugging the developer can avoid **complex one-use testing code**, which helps the developer save time and energy in software development.
